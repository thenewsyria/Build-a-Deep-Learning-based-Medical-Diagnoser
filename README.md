### 📅 Last Updated: 23 Sep, 2024  

## 📌 Overview  
Imagine getting **disease predictions and medication prescriptions** in seconds using **Artificial Intelligence (AI).** With the power of **Deep Learning**, this project makes that possible.  

This project utilizes **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** to analyze **textual medical data**. The model takes **patient symptoms as input** and predicts the **most likely disease** along with the **recommended medication** as output.

## 🚀 Implementation: Medical Diagnosis with LSTM  
This project builds an **LSTM-based deep learning model** trained on medical data, including:  
- **Patient Symptoms:** Textual descriptions of patient problems.  
- **Diagnoses:** Predicted diseases.  
- **Medications:** Recommended treatments.  

### 📌 Model Architecture  
1️⃣ **Text Processing:**  
- Tokenization using `Tokenizer` from TensorFlow.  
- Padding sequences with `pad_sequences`.  
- Label encoding using `LabelEncoder`.  

2️⃣ **Deep Learning Model:**  
- **LSTM layer** to capture long-term dependencies in symptoms.  
- **Dense layers** for disease prediction.  
- **Separate output layer** for medication recommendations.
